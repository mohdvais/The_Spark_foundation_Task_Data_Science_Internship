# About the task: 
Task1:

      • Predict the percentage of an student based on the no. of study hours unsig Machine learning.                             
      • What will be predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/ day?

## Here are the requirements:

    The dataset being used for this example has been made publicly available at this link http://bit.ly/w-data
    Predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hours per day.
    
## Simple Linear Regression
    In this regression task we will predict the percentage of mark that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours they studied. This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just two variables.
